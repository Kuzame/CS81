Write a short explanation of what is Node.js and how is it related to JavaScript.
Node.js is a framework or environment (which is open source and free) that uses JavaScript on the server. It is able to open a file on the server and return the content to the client (the output for ex). It's a JavaScript runtime, in a sense so that we don't have to use a browser to test the JavaScript code.
